Taught data structures
1.Array
2.LinkedList
a.Singly Linked List
b.Doubly Linked List
c.Circular Linked List
3.Stack
4.Queue

#Phonebook management have three main operations:
#1.Searching
#2.Sorting
#3.Deleting
These three operation can be performed efficiently(among above data structures) with Linked List. Doubly Linked List because while searching first element but the current status of pointer is in between middle and first element so it should traverse backward because then it will take less time.

Time complexities in O
1.Searching O(n)
2.Deletion O(n)
3.Sorting O(n*Log n)

OPERATIONS IMPLEMENTED.............
1)DELETE SAME NUMBER
2)DELETE SAME NAME
3)SEARCH
4)DELETE CONATCT
5)DISPLAY CONTACT-In sorted(bubble sort) display
6)UPDATE DETAILS-A)NAME
B)NUMBER
